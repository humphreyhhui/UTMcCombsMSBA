- Tested CAPM and Fama-French 3-Factor models on 25 size/book-to-market portfolios (1990-2024) using time-series regressions to estimate alphas and betas, GRS F-tests to jointly test alpha significance, and Fama-MacBeth cross-sectional regressions with Shanken corrections to measure factor risk premia.

- Found FF3F explained 94% of portfolio variance (vs. 70% for CAPM) with lower average alpha, though only market risk factor achieved statistical significance; high book-to-market portfolios showed 42% higher mean returns, with small-cap portfolios exhibiting greater variance and lower model fit.

- Tech Stack: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, scipy
